        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter your HTML notes here</li>
          <li>HTML means Hypertext Markup Language</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser 
            and the developer eg the form and table elements.</li>
          <li>Element and tag are used interchangably, however, elements refer to the 
            entire element, from from opening tag to closing tag while tag refers 
            only to what appears inside the angle bracket.</li>
          <li>The header tag appears at the top of a page and usually contains 
            a navigation menu.</li>
          <li>When using headings, it is important to use them in order from h1 to h6.</li>
          <li>The biggest heading h1 should only appear once on each page.</li>
          <li>HTML uses the id attribute as a way to identify elements and select them.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter your CSS notes here</li>
          <li>CSS means Cascading Style Sheet</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around thecontent inside an element.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules or declearations will apply</li>
          <li>Declearations contain two important components: the css property and the value.</li>
          <li>display: block; asssigns the element to start on a new line.</li>
          <li>Class attributs allows us to share a CSS rule to any element 
            we choose by assigning the rule to the class attribute with a class selector.<li>
          <li>The box-shadow property adds a shadow effect around an elements frame.</li>
          <li>The CSS file is linked within the head element usint the link tag</li>
          
        </ul>

          <li>git clone: Clones a repo into a new directory</li>
          <li>git add: Adds file contents to index</li>
          <li>git add -A: To add all modifications in the staging area</li>
          <li>git commit: Records changes to the repository</li>
          <li>git commit -m "description of what was done": To commit changes with comment describing what was done </li>
          <li>git branch: Lists, creates or deletes branches</li>
          <li>git pull: Fetches and downloads content from a remote repository and immediately updates 
            the local repo to match that content</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: Pulls the remote main branch into the local main branch so local and 
            remote are in sync</li>
          <li>git push: Uploads local repository content to a remote repository</li>
          <li>touch script.js: creates a new file named script.js</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter your JavaScript note here</li>
          <li>JavaScript is an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language.</li>
          <li>To declare a variable, use the var keyword</li>
          <li>After the var keyword, give the variable a unique name</li>
          <li>Finally, use the assignment operator, = , to assign the 
            specific data that is to be stored in the variable</li>
            <li>var shape = "circle"; Shape is the variable and the data it stores is "circle"</li>
            <li>All strings must be contained within quotation marks " "</li>
            <li>The console.log method is used to output a message to the web console</li>
            <li>The script file is linked within the body element using the script tag</li>
            <li>var topics = "HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript";: This is a variable declearation with string values</li>
            <li>console.log(topics); : Logs variables to the web console in browser</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
            <li>Computers read code in a linear way (from top to bottom)</li>
            <li>Developers can achieve the logic of causing a computer to deviate from the 
              normal linear flow by using if statements.</li>
            <li>An array is a single value that is used to hold a group of related data</li>
            <li>To declare an array, you use the var keyword 
              eg var shapes = ["circle", "square", "oval", "triangle"];</li>
            <li>Arrays are useful when performing a task on multiple pieces of data at once.</li>
            <li>A single array can store differnt data types such as string, number, boolean etc.</li>
            <li>Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential i.e the first item in an array has an 
              index of 0, not 1</li>
            <li>In order to access an individual item in an array, we use an array index</li>
            <li>An array index is a number indicating each items place in the order of the list</li>
            <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the 
              items in an array by allowing the code block to be executed over and over.</li>
            <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to 
              perform a certain task.</li>
            <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because 
              functions do not execute automatically when a JS file is run. A function must be called 
            by name in order to execute it.</li>
            <li>A function groups a set of instructions so each time you need it, all you need to do 
              is call the function.</li>
            <li>Functions in JS are used to define and reuse blocks of code.</li>
            <li>It is important to note that a function name is followed by parenthesis.</li>
            <li>A function must have a unique name.</li>
